    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this classification project, the goal is to detect credit card fraud using the dataset found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kelvinkelue/credit-card-fraud-prediction). The project involves various stages, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, hypothesis testing, and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Scheme\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration**:\n",
    "   - Initially, the dataset was thoroughly studied, examining each available feature and its format to gain insights into the data structure.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - Some features that were deemed irrelevant or not useful for the analysis were removed from the dataset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Age categories were created based on the age of individuals in the dataset, and they were subsequently encoded for further analysis.\n",
    "   - Features such as category, gender, and state were also encoded to prepare them for modeling.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Income Category**:\n",
    "   - A new feature representing income category was created by assigning income categories to job titles using Google Gemini.\n",
    "   - An observation was made that card fraud was more prevalent among individuals in the middle-income category, prompting further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
    "   - A hypothesis test was conducted to determine the significance of the observed difference in card fraud rates among different income categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Incorporation of Additional Data**:\n",
    "   - Total crime statistics from each state in 2008 were obtained from a supplementary dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabhishm/united-states-crime-rates-by-city-population/data).\n",
    "   - This data was preprocessed and merged with the existing card fraud dataset to provide additional insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Entries from states not included in the crime dataset were removed to ensure data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - A custom class was developed to facilitate model training, prediction, and evaluation.\n",
    "   - The class provides functionality to calculate accuracy scores and generate confusion matrices for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Model Implementation**:\n",
    "   - The custom class was instantiated for each classification model to be trained, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LDA, K-Nearest Neighbors, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "    - Finally, the performance of each model was evaluated, and the confusion matrix from the model with the highest accuracy score was plotted for further analysis.\n"

I can safely assume the id will not have any relation to fraudulent actions. I will also remove first and last name, as one can think of name as something entirely random. I will also remove 'Trans_num', that is the transaction identifier. I will also drop some columns I don't intend to use. I will delete the columns related to location coordinates and the merchant column."

    "It is pretty clear that the job of the individual will be a predictor for credit card fraud. The relationship is in the salary. However, the data I have at hand is not very useful since a single string with a job title that may even be ambiguous such as 'computer', will not be of much use. I will use gemini to relate each of the jobs to a salary category: 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low', representing the income related to that job. This however, has flaws in the fact that Gemini may provide with false information ever so often and may struggle to understand some of these job titles (as they can be quite ambiguous). "
